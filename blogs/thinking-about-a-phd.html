        <h2>Thinking about a PhD and new Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            I have been developing a software and app for construction companies. That is why we have been talking with owners of those type of companies, to figure out their problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now you may think these do not relate at all to a PhD. But it does. Building this software and a PhD have a few things in common. One of them is that I donâ€™t know what am I going to find, I may have an idea of the conclusion of my investigation but in
            practice it all comes out to experiments and real life feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having a dream is fine. Working everyday to achieve a desire outcome is great. I will learn even if I do not achieve my goal. In the case of the software I get to meet business owners, learn about their necessities and how the construction industry works.
            In the case of a PhD you dive deep into a topic, master it and get to meet other people with the same desire and different knowledge. The main difference is the time invested. This are some of my thoughts on PhDs.
